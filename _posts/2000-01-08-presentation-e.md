### Analyzing Ciceronian Networks with Gephi
{: .title}
Caitlin Marley  
*University of Iowa*  
1:50-2:30pm

Explore [Ciceroâ€™s social network](https://classicalstudies.org/scs-blog/caitlin-marley/blog-digitally-mapping-ciceros-networks-letters-and-emotions) and learn to make your own network map. I will describe how we can map different social interactions in Cicero's letters, from the exchange of letters to gossip. I will also show you how to make quick visualizations of those interactions in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Come with the latest version of Gephi already downloaded; datasets will be provided to get participants started.
