### Lightning Talks
Patrick J. Burns, Moderator  
*Institute for the Study of the Ancient World*  
11:30am-12:30pm  

In the interest of bringing attention to as many projects in Digital Classics, Archaeology, and related fields as possible, Ancient MakerSpaces 2019 will host an hour-long <i>Lightning Talks</i> session. Presenters will have four minutes each to introduce their project, address its application in Classics research, pedagogy, or outreach, and explain how contributors, volunteers, or users can get involved.

AMS2019 Lightning Talks will include [SCS Membership Map](https://edbkeogh.github.io/SCS_Membership_Map/demo/), [PlayCanvas for Archaeology](https://playcanv.as/p/0lWLqdtm/), [Coptic Scriptorium](http://copticscriptorium.org/), [Krateros](www.ias.edu/krateros), [Database of Religious History](https://religiondatabase.org/landing/), and more.

If you are interested in participating in the <i>Lightning Talks</i>, contact Patrick J. Burns at [patrick.j.burns@nyu.edu](patrick.j.burns@nyu.edu).
