### From Stone to Screen and the DIY Method: Digitization, Integration, and You
{: .title}
Chelsea Gardner  
*University of British Columbia*  
9:00-9:40am

The [From Stone to Screen](http://fromstonetoscreen.com/) project is an open-access digitization project founded in 2012 by graduate students at the University of British Columbia. Since its inception, it has evolved into a pedagogical resource for the study of ancient artifacts and epigraphic squeezes. This project has also been illustrative of the difficulties faced by small-scale DH projects with limited funding, and this presentation showcases some of the “DIY” solutions to these problems. Following a brief presentation about the current mission statement of the project, the directors of the project will demonstrate three aspects of From Stone to Screen through interactive workstations: 1) the process of squeeze image manipulation in Photoshop; 2) the various successful (and not-so-successful) web hosting platforms and social media endeavours; and 3) the open-access pedagogical resources produced through our collections.
