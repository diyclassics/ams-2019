## Lightning Talks
Patrick J. Burns, Moderator  
*Institute for the Study of the Ancient World*  
11:30am-12:30pm  

In the interest of bringing attention to as many projects in Digital Classics, Archaeology, and related fields as possible, Ancient MakerSpaces 2019 will host an hour-long <i>Lightning Talks</i> session. Presenters will have three minutes each to introduce their project, address its application in Classics research, pedagogy, or outreach, and explain how contributors, volunteers, or users can get involved. If you are interested in participating in the <i>Lightning Talks</i>, contact Patrick J. Burns at [patrick.j.burns@nyu.edu](patrick.j.burns@nyu.edu).
