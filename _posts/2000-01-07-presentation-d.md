### Make Your Own Ancient Studies Podcast
{: .title}
Scott Aaron Lepisto  
*Hillsdale College*  
1:00-1:40pm

This workshop takes participants through every step of developing a [podcast](http://itinerapodcast.libsyn.com/), from the idea phase through publication. It will cover conceptual, legal, and technical aspects, including audio editing using [Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity), operating a Zoom H4N portable audio recorder, and publishing through [Libsyn](https://www.libsyn.com/), a podcast-hosting platform. You can use podcasts to flip the classroom, communicate research to a broad audience, or as a forum to discuss classics in ways that might not fit into traditional academic discourses.
